# Cat Clicker
A simple enough webpage that lets you select a cat (functionality pending) and
it will count how many times you click on or near that particular cat. The cats
are organized into a **military hierarchy** and they are a tight _knit_ bunch.
# Usage
Once you have the files in hand(or on your machine as it were) open the index.html
file and begin the clickfest.
# Dependencies
These cat pictures are not my own. They came from the internet as most things cat
do. Without the cat pictures, this cat clicker project would be bland and boring.
While I am **not** a cat person, I do appreciate that these cats lend their likeness so
that I might be able to use them for training purposes. Thanks cats! _(and the people
that took the pictures of the cats and shared them on the internet)_
